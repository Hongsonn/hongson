If you get following error, when you try to start nginxâ€¦

[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)

Then it means nginx or some other process is already using port 80.

You can kill it using:

sudo fuser -k 80/tcp

And then try restarting nginx again:

service nginx start
